####Titanic readme 

**str(titanic)**

    *This checks the structure of the titanic data frame. 
\

**ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge")**


    *This calls ggplot from the ggplot2 package.  Inside we set the x axis as Pclass and fill as sex which separates male from female.  (Light red female and light blue for male.) 
    *geom_bar creates a bar chart. 
    *Position dodge has them stack side by side. Without it they would stack on top of each other. 
    
\

**ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") + facet_grid(.~Survived)**
    
    *Separates facet into columns based on survived

\


**posn.jd <- position_jitterdodge(0.5, 0, 0.6)**
    
    *This will avoid overlapping when we plot it as points.  Without this male and female would overlap each other. 
    *Jitter- adding random noise to prevent overplotting. 
    *Jitter width- Degree of jitter in x direction
    *Jitter Height – degree of jitter in y direction
    *Dodge width – amount of dodge in x direction.

**ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Pclass, y = Age, color = Sex)) + geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5, position = posn.jd) + facet_grid(.~Survived)**

    *geom_point plot as dots instead of bars. 
    *Alpha is the transparency of the dots. 
    *Size is the size of the dot.
